- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis
- Create a meta-analysis/systematic for scientific/academic papers
- Synthesize academic papers across a wide variety of topics as a meta-review using an Agent that oversees and filters out documents based on topic, material covered.

## What's the Idea?
Develop a systematic review/meta-analysis application that searches relevant papers based on a topic of choice and compiles a review of those papers.

For a POC, create a TLDR for Academic Articles - grabs highlights from Introduction, Method, Results, Conclusions and compiles a review of those documents in the following ways.

## Tech Stack: 
-> Python
-> LangGraph
-> Postgres - stores graph state
-> Academic Article APIs - Explore Limitations

## Use Case: 
Use Generative AI to compile papers from a given topic and get a systematic overview of them - finding similarities and dissimilarities in the literature.


## What's the Goal?
The ultimate goal is to be able to gain understanding information from various research domains, through meta-analysis or systematic review.
