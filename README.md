**Systematic Review of Scientific Articles**

    #### Overview 
    An advanced academic paper review system that automates the creation of systematic literature reviews. This solution uses a directed graph architecture to orchestrate a complex workflow, transforming research topics into comprehensive review papers through autonomous planning, research, analysis, and writing stages.

    #### Implementation 
    â€¢ Implement a directed graph workflow that orchestrates systematic review generation through sequential stages of planning, research, paper selection, content analysis, parallel section writing, automated critique, and revision cycles, using GPT-4o for content generation and Semantic Scholar API for paper retrieval.


## What's the Goal?
- Use Generative AI to compile papers from a given topic and get a systematic overview of their contents. 
- Find similarities and dissimilarities in the literature?
- Be able to gain understanding information from various research domains, through meta-analysis or systematic review.
